### Tic-Tac-Toe Game App

This application was created for the purpose of practicing coding in React JS.

In this game, two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does. The game ends when there is a winner or if all the spaces on the grid are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
